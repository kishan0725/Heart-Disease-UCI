# Heart-Disease-UCI


   In this project, I will be applying Machine Learning approaches for classifying whether a person is suffering from a heart disease or not, using one of the most used dataset â€” [Cleveland Heart Disease](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) dataset from the [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).
